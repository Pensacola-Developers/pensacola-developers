The web development world can be so overwhelming. Let's ignore all the latest trends and frameworks, and let's go back to the basics. That's right! We're going to go back and explore good ole HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What do you need to start:
Browser - https://www.google.com/chrome/
IDE - https://code.visualstudio.com/
Extension - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer

If you don't have a mac or pc please use https://codepen.io/pen/***

Quick Instructions:
Make sure you have chrome installed from the link above. Once complete please install the VSCode IDE. This is where we will write code. The extension is not required for the course, but I will be using it. It will make your life a little easier as it refreshes the browser for you automatically.
