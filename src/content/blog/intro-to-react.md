React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. Facebook used React in internal tools until May 2013, when it became open source for all web developers to use. Since then it has been maintained by Facebook.

## What is React?

React is an open source JavaScript library for building rich user interfaces that run in users web browsers. It focuses soley on rendering and event handling functionality. Rendering is the conversion of data that describes the state of the user interface into DOM (Document Object Model) objects. The browser can use to produce a user interface that the user can see and interact with. React's event handling lets the programmer detect when the user interacts with the program, and how the program should respond.

## Why Use React?

### Simplicity

If you already have some basics of HTML and JavaScript down, you can get up and running with React. React is a lightweight library that works only dealing with the view layer. Some other frameworks come with much more overhead and knowledge needed to get going.

### Reuseable Components

The concept of reusable components helps you re-use your code to maintain and grow your codebase. This also helps you speed up the proccess of developing websites and applications. If you have already built a component, you can update them by just modifying one file.
